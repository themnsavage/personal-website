                <p>I first got into computer science back in sophmore year of highschool, when I took a intro class to computer science. This class showed me my love for problem solving, 
                    and how i can use code to create cool projects. I am currently a senior at The University of Alabama studying computer science. 
                    During my junior year of college I was a lab teacher assistance,
                    for introduction classes for computer science at The University of Alabama. My job was helping students understand computer science topics like 
                    merge sort, hash tables, djkstra algorithm, etc. After this I did a COOP semester with the company Adtran located in Huntsville Alabama. I was on a system
                    team called team gurren. What I did during this COOP semester was develope packages, tools, automation, and unit/integration tests.
